# Main

## Why Table Top?
### Cryptography
- IPSec / SSL / TLS
- Priv

### Cryptanalysis
- Engima
- Alan Turing
- Modern Computing

## Terms
- Cryptography - crypto secret text
- Cipher text - encrypted message
- cypher - method of creating
- encryption - process
- cryptology - study of crypto
- cryptanalysis - study of breaking

## History
- Egypt: Heiroglyphic substitution to mentrion Pharoah
- China: Would cover a message in wax to hide stuff
- Hebrew Scribes: (900BC) "Abbash" smushing together of letters in hebrew
- Kama Sutra: not just sex, 46 diff skills person should cultivate.  Included art of secret writing (substitution cipher)
- Scytale: First military crypto (by Spartans ~ 475 BCE). Transposition cypher. Effective because a lot of illiteracy back in tha day.
- Caesar Cypher (Rot): Caesar used Rot3.  Used in Ancient Rome. Subsitution Cypher. Rot13 is very common
EX:
PNZQL VF QNAQL OHG YVDHBE VF DHVPXRE
CANDY IS DANDY BUT LIQUOR IS QUICKER

### Early Cryptanalysis
- Al-Kindi's On Decrypting and Encrypted Correspondence - First freq analysis
- Subh Al-A Sha
- European Monks - used crypto in books

### Vigenere Cypher:
- Series of diff Caesar Cyphers
- Uses a keyword
- Tabula recta
- Polyalphabetic substitution cypher
- Babbage was legit

### Vigenere Still in Use
- Hal-001 "Vigenere Wheel": Field crypto for SF in the 1990s (Good Cyphers last a long time)
- One Time Pass

### Enigma Machine
- Rotor Based
- Designed by Arthur Scherbius around 1918
- Transposition Cypher
- Paper Engima Machine (Michael C. Koss) circa 2003.  Made completely out of paper.
- The Poles began attempting to decrypt before anyone else.
