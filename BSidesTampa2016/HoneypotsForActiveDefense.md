Title: Honeypots For Active Defense

By: Greg Foss

# Notes
- Makes sure to include warning on your systems that you can "return fire"
- Use a passive honeypot to build information on attacker
- "[Artillery](https://github.com/BinaryDefense/artillery)"
- Just using Tor isn't enough, traffic will be sniffed.
- Medium activity honeypot - largest saturation
- High interaction honeypot - full system, real services
- Change your MAC before you go hacking :^)
