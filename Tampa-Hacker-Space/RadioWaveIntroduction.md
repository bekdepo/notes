Title: Introduction to Antennas and Radio Waves
Date: 1-2-2016

#Electromagnetic Waves
- Electricity (blues)
- Magnetism (red)
- Electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field
- Don't require a medium
- Measured as both particle and wave properties
	- Electronic volts
	- Hertz
- Speeds 180,000 miles/second or 3x10^8 meters/second
- Wavelength is lambda (wavelength in meters) = V (velocity)/F (frequency in hertz)
- Lot of IoT/FCC fuckery in VHF (30 to 300MHz) and UHF (300 to 3,000 MHz)

#Radio Wave Propagation
- Ground Waves travel along the surface
- Sky Waves travel from the transmitter to one of the ionospheric layers and is returned to the earth (art vs science) (can be very low power)
- Reflection (same angle it strikes)
- Refraction (bending through)
- Diffraction (bending around)
- Absorption (agitation of object's matter)
- Scatter (multi-directional bounces)
- Man-made and natural objs
- Critical Freq
- Minimum power for transmission (based upon receiver's condition) (transition.fcc.gov/pshs/techtopics/techtopics17.html);
- * HF is preferred since it is a good combination of distance and power required *
- SOMETIMES THE SUN CAN FUCK YOUR SHIT UP (aka sunspots), thus a lot of * important * stuff is done at night
- Can use low power on an in use frequency w/ modulation to mask signal
